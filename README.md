<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![Product Banner][product-banner]]()
There are many interview prep resources for software engineers out there on the web—the most notorious being LeetCode; however, while software engineers can practice active recall for technical interiviews doing DSA problems, there is no real way to practice retrieval of UI/UX design principles in preperation for design interviews. So we decided to make it. The First Structured Interview Prep Platform for UI/UX Design.

Here are the planned features:
* Generate UI/UX interview practice problems
* Draw diagrams for the given problem using Excalidraw
* Have a conversation with an AI interviewer real-time about constraints and the general deisgn process
* Receive rubric based scoring that evaluates user transcripts, diagramming, and task/constraint alignment
* View stats on problems solved, daily activity, etc.

We are still early in the development process and are currently focused on flushing out the main MVP. More features will surface as we go through development which wil be queued for after the MVP is complete.
